    <h2>About My Work</h2>
    <p>
        I make art since I was a child and I have stopped to think and consider what could it mean to me to make art or what does it mean universally if there's a possiblity for an answer to that and to think if there is any chance of any answer about art. Most is my work is abstract but this isn't a rule. I think of communication in art as a field were a shared experience happens more than the delivery of an information item from a creator to a consumer.     </p>

    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <p>

        My inspiration is every day life. And my every day life has been for the past 3 years making NFTs and being in front of a computer, so big part of what I make speaks about that and about this way of living. Another big source of inspiration for me is my daughter and parenthood, I love my kid and I learn a lot from  her.     </p>

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>
        My process always starts with work half done from the day before or from days before. I have projects that last months or take months to be created, and I also make pieces that are just what I need to say in that minute. While this happens I am all day every day drawing if I don't need my hands for other things, or clicking to AI image generators to see more images, or processing images inside of inkscape, gimp, blender.     </p>
